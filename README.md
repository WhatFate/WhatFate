## TL;DR
Aspiring Solidity & dApp developer Â· 2 years into Web3 Â· learning fast and building real projects Â· open to collaborations.

I chose the Web3 direction because I believe that the idea of cryptocurrency can become something ordinary in the future â€” if the right people are involved to ensure security, transparency, and to preserve the core idea of cryptocurrency.
