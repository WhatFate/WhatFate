## TL;DR
Aspiring Solidity & dApp developer · 6 months into Web3 · learning fast and building real projects · open to collaborations.

## Why Web3?
I chose the Web3 direction because I believe that the idea of cryptocurrency can become something ordinary in the future — if the right people are involved to ensure security, transparency, and to preserve the core idea of cryptocurrency.

## Tech stack
- **Languages:** Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Testing:** Foundry (forge)  
- **Security tools:** Slither, Echidna, MythX (static + fuzzing)  
- **Frontend:** React, ethers.js, wagmi/RainbowKit  
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, deployment scripts, dotenv  

## Currently learning
- Smart contract security patterns  
- Advanced testing (fuzzing & invariant tests with Foundry)
